Differential Gene Expression Analysis using DESeq2 of Breast Cancer RNA-seq Samples

The following report uses an RNA-seq dataset obtained from a study by Jiao, et al., (2019) to investigate the transcriptomic changes between breast cancer cells treated with NRDE2-targeting siRNAâ€™s that cause NRDE2 depletion and control breast cancer cells not treated. The dataset contains 6 total fastq files from single end sequencing of 3 treated samples and 3 control samples.

I do this by conducting an analysis to get the count data from RNA-seq data to then detect differentially expressed genes by running an analysis using DESeq2 to compare the transcript expression between the two classes of samples, and to also characterize deferentially expressed genes that couple be potentially be impacted by knocking down NRDE2.
